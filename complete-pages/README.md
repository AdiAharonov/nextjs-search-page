# Advanced Search Page in Next.js with TypeScript

## Introduction

This project showcases an advanced search page built using Next.js and TypeScript. It demonstrates best practices in frontend development, including the use of asynchronous data fetching methods, state management, and unit testing. The search functionality is designed to provide a seamless user experience, leveraging modern web technologies and frameworks.

## Features

- **Next.js**: Utilizes the latest features of Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation to deliver a fast and SEO-friendly search page.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed programming language for JavaScript that ensures code reliability and maintainability.
- **Asynchronous Data Fetching**: Implements various async options to handle API requests, including `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, and client-side fetching with SWR or React Query.
- **State Management**: Uses Context API or Zustand for global state management, ensuring that the search criteria and results are managed efficiently across the application.
- **Responsive Design**: Adopts a mobile-first approach to ensure the search page is accessible and user-friendly on all devices.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes a comprehensive suite of tests using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure code quality and functionality.

### Best Practices

- **Type Safety**: Ensure all components and utilities are strongly typed.
- **Async Handling**: Use async/await syntax for asynchronous operations and handle exceptions properly.
- **Reusable Components**: Design UI components to be reusable and maintainable.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement lazy loading for images and conditional fetching for data.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the search page is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
